## 📋 Project Overview
The **Student Stress Level Prediction** system is a machine learning application designed to analyze and predict the stress levels of students based on various psychological, environmental, and academic factors. By leveraging advanced ML algorithms, this tool provides real-time insights and personalized advice to help students manage their mental well-being effectively.

This project aims to bridge the gap between academic pressure and mental health awareness, offering a data-driven approach to understanding student stress.
